Completionist is a comprehensive completion-tracking framework for **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition**.

It provides an in-game interface for tracking quests, items and other collectible or completion-related content across Skyrim, the official DLC and supported third-party mods.

The **NG** version is the native-code continuation of Completionist, built using modern Skyrim modding technologies and **CommonLibSSE-NG**.

## Features

### Quest Tracking

Completionist automatically tracks your progress through supported quests and presents completion information through the in-game MCM.

This includes support for:

* Main quests
* Side quests
* DLC quests
* Radiant and repeatable quests
* Supported mod-added quests
* Quest stages that do not use conventional completion states

Where necessary, Completionist records relevant quest-stage information so that quests which stop rather than formally complete can still be tracked accurately.

### Item & Collectible Tracking

Completionist provides tracking for a wide range of collectible content, including:

* Books
* Spell tomes
* Weapons
* Armour
* Unique items
* Collectibles
* Other supported completion-related content

The tracking system is designed to provide a single place to monitor overall completion progress.

### MCM Integration

Completionist provides extensive **SkyUI MCM** integration, allowing you to configure and monitor your completion progress directly in-game.

### Inventory Integration

Completionist can integrate with the player's inventory and provide configurable visual indicators for tracked collectables.

### Dynamic Crosshair Tags

The Dynamic Crosshair Tags system can identify tracked items while they are being targeted.

The system is configurable, including:

* Tag text
* Tag colour
* Category visibility
* Display behaviour

### Extensive Mod Support

Completionist supports tracking content from a large number of popular Skyrim mods.

The project is designed so that additional tracking data can be maintained and extended without requiring the core tracking system to be rewritten.

## Requirements

The following are required:

* **Skyrim Special Edition / Anniversary Edition**
* **SKSE64**
* **Address Library for SKSE Plugins**
* **PapyrusUtil SE**
* **SkyUI**

See the [Nexus Mods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46358) for the current supported versions and installation information.

### Recommended

Completionist was originally developed and designed with **Dear Diary - Dark Mode** in mind.

Completionist should work with other UI configurations, but UI mods based on Dear Diary Dark Mode may provide the best visual presentation for the MCM.

---

## Installation

Install Completionist using your preferred mod manager.

Ensure that all required dependencies are installed and that **SKSE64** is being used to launch Skyrim.

After installation, launch the game and allow Completionist to initialise.

The Completionist MCM can then be accessed through SkyUI.
